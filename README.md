# Stray Dog Detection Using DeepLearning Techniques

INTRODUCTION

Stray dogs present various challenges, including public safety concerns, the risk of disease
transmission, and environmental health issues. The lack of an effective system to monitor and
manage stray dogs exacerbates these problems, leading to potential threats to both humans and
animals. While some solutions exist, they often fail to provide real-time monitoring, accurate
detection, and immediate alerts for appropriate action.

OBJECTIVE

The motivation behind this project is to develop an efficient and real-time system for stray dog
detection and alerting the concerned authorities. Unlike existing solutions, which are limited
in scope and effectiveness, our approach integrates deep learning techniques to enhance
accuracy and response times.

KEY COMPONENTS INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT

> Pre-processing: Data cleaning, augmentation, and preparation for training.

> YOLOv11: A state-of-the-art object detection model used for identifying stray dogs
in real-time.

> MobileNetV2: A lightweight neural network model optimized for mobile and
embedded vision applications.

> Twilio: A cloud-based communication platform used to send automated pop-up alerts
to the relevant authorities.
